_The Bracelet_


It all started with that one bracelet. That one bracelet that was passed down generation after generation. Some say we were cursed, but i believed it was more than that. i've witnessed generation after generation getting handed that very important family heirloom, once they turned 18. Some say having that bracelet would curse you for life, but to me. it was like a present being handed to me once i became of age. But what i didn't know was, that sometimes its better to listen to people. It all started on the day of my 18th birthday.


The room somehow had seemed like it had darkened. The whole family as sitting in a circle. curtains drawn closed and candles all lit up, it was as though we were performing a ritual. The older family members started softly mumbling words that i counldn't understand. But to me, that wasn't important. All the ran through my head was how i had imgained. I imagined it to be a night of fun
