_The Bracelet_


It all started with that one bracelet. That one bracelet that was passed down generation after generation. Some say we were cursed, but I believed it was more than that. I've witnessed generation after generation getting handed that very important family heirloom, once they turned 18. Some say having that bracelet would curse you for life, but to me, it was like a present being handed to me once I became of age. But what I didn't know was, that sometimes it's better to listen to people. It all started on the day of my 18th birthday.


The room somehow had seemed like it had darkened. The whole family sitting in a circle. curtains drawn closed and candles all lit up, it was as though we were performing a ritual. The older family members started softly mumbling words that i couldn't understand. But to me, that wasn't important. All the ran through my head was how i had imagined. I imagined it to be a night of fun, like going to the club with my friends, but no one gave me a heads up that i would be spending my birthday in some shabby looking apartment looking like we were in some cult. But the thought of having the family heirloom sparked some excitement in me. But boy was I wrong.


Once everyone finished praying, the family heirloom was taken out, Curiosity got the best of me and i tried to look at it, only to get smacked on the back of my head by my mother telling me that i couldn't see it until i was wearing it. Eager to know more, I asked her if I had to keep it on forever but her response shocked me. She told me that I had to wear it until the next person in the family turned 18. As i thought about it, the next person in the family that was going to turn 18 was Maya, my 10 year-old sister. I swallowed the lump forming in my throat, ready to face whatever was to come next. 


After the ceremony was over, I jumped out of where i was sitting and rushed to grab my coat. As I grabbed my coat, I noticed the bracelet on my hand, it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It was a pretty shade of azure blue, covered in beautiful sapphire rhinestones. As I was about to go out, my grandmother stopped me in my tracks and told me, "Be careful, dear, the bracelet contains a curse that no one can understand." But her words fell on deaf ears as I ran out of the house and slammed the door on my way out.
