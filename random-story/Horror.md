_The Bracelet_


It all started with that one bracelet. That one bracelet that was passed down generation after generation. Some say we were cursed, but I believed it was more than that. I've witnessed generation after generation getting handed that very important family heirloom, once they turned 18. Some say having that bracelet would curse you for life, but to me, it was like a present being handed to me once I became of age. But what I didn't know was, that sometimes it's better to listen to people. It all started on the day of my 18th birthday.


The room somehow had seemed like it had darkened. The whole family sitting in a circle. curtains drawn closed and candles all lit up, it was as though we were performing a ritual. The older family members started softly mumbling words that i couldn't understand. But to me, that wasn't important. All the ran through my head was how i had imagined. I imagined it to be a night of fun, like going to the club with my friends, but no one gave me a heads up that i would be spending my birthday in some shabby looking apartment looking like we were in some cult. But the thought of having the family heirloom sparked some excitement in me. But boy was I wrong.


Once everyone finished praying, the family heirloom was taken out, Curiosity got the best of me and i tried to look at it, only to get smacked on the back of my head by my mother telling me that i couldn't see it until i was wearing it. Eager to know more, I asked her if I had to keep it on forever but her response shocked me. She told me that I had to wear it until the next person in the family turned 18. As i thought about it, the next person in the family that was going to turn 18 was Maya, my 10 year-old sister. I swallowed the lump forming in my throat, ready to face whatever was to come next. 


After the ceremony was over, I jumped out of where i was sitting and rushed to grab my coat. As I grabbed my coat, I noticed the bracelet on my hand, it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. It was a pretty shade of azure blue, covered in beautiful sapphire rhinestones. As I was about to go out, my grandmother stopped me in my tracks and told me, "Be careful, dear, the bracelet contains a curse that no one can understand." But her words fell on deaf ears as I ran out of the house and slammed the door on my way out.


Once i was outside, i stared down at the bracelet. I was mesmerized by it. It was like a shade of blue that i had never seem before. Suddenly, the air around me started to turn cold, the wind started getting stronger and stronger and i felt chills run down my spine. But as i looked around me, it seemed as though no one was bothered by it at all. They all seemed as though nothing was going on. So, i decided to continue on walking telling myself that it was probably because i hadn't sleep it days sine i was so excited about my birthday. But I couldn't deny that with every step that i had took, it felt as though the temperature was dropping. It was as if the temperature was dropping rapidly by the second.


As I arrived at the club where I was supposed to meet my friends, I felt as though someone was following me. I ignored that presence an headed into the club. As i saw my friends, it felt as though a wave of relief washed over me. Soon after an hour we were drinking shots. I felt as though i was on cloud nine. I was definitely drunk. Suddenly i felt someone breathing against my neck. It sent chills down my spine. I ignored it and continued to drink. But suddenly i heard a soft whisper in my ear, "kill... kill..." I screamed. Hearing that voice immediately made me sober.


My friends looked at me and asked,"Why are you screaming Ailee?" I responded in a hush tone, "Didn't you guys hear that voice?" They responded with a puzzled look on their face, "What voice?" I stared at them. I couldn't believe my ears. How was i the only person who had heard that voice. The voice was incredibly low, it sounded sinister-like. Then it suddenly striked in me, my grandmother said something but a curse but i didn't listen. 


My face turned pale, and i started shivering. I was scared. Then i heard that voice again. It whispered, " Kill... i want to kill..." I shuddered, i couldn't imagine what it was trying to mean. I covered my ears, wanting to block out the voice. But it didn't seem to go away. I figured i was just hallucinating at first, but boy was i wrong.
